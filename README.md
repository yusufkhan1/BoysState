# BoysState

This repository is for the purpose of creating a web interface to help administrators and others at Boys State easily and accessibly search alumni of the Cornhusker Boys State program by their Zip Code, Last Name, and Home Town. This will be useful in the future for historians to look up famous almuni of their town, as well as if the legion wants to do a press release for someone that got elected to office in the future and was a past Boys Stater. 

The technologies that we are using include a MySQL database with all of the information on past almuni, a python based code for a web interface, and an apache server to have the python code operate on. 

There will be three boxes for people to type either zip code, last name, etc. and after that all of the results based on the search parameters will show up from the MySQL database.

In the future we can work on making sure that the data that shows once searched will be adapatable in that it can be organized by first letter of last name down the list or by the hometown, etc.
